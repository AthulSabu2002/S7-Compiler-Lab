## üß™ Experiments

### Lexical Analysis

1. **Custom Lexical Analyzer (C)**
   - Implement a lexical analyzer to recognize valid tokens in an input program
   - Handle spaces, tabs, newlines, and comments

2. **Lex Tool Experiments**
   2.1. Implement a Lexical Analyzer using Lex
   2.2. Count lines, words, and characters in an input text
   2.3. Convert substring 'abc' to 'ABC' in an input string
   2.4. Count vowels and consonants in an input string

### Syntax Analysis

3. **YACC Specifications**
   3.1. Recognize valid arithmetic expressions (+, -, *, /, parentheses)
   3.2. Recognize valid identifiers (letter followed by letters/digits)
   3.3. Implement a calculator using LEX and YACC

4. **NFA Œµ-Closure**
   - Find Œµ-closure of all states in an NFA with Œµ-transitions

5. **First and Follow Sets**
   - Calculate First and Follow sets for a given grammar

6. **Shift-Reduce Parser**
   - Construct a Shift-Reduce Parser for a given language

### Code Optimization

7. **Code Optimization Techniques**
   - Simulate various code optimization techniques

### Code Generation

8. **Intermediate Code Generation**
   - Generate intermediate code for simple expressions

9. **Backend Compiler Implementation**
   - Implement a compiler backend that converts three-address code to 8086 assembly language

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run these experiments, you'll need:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Lex/Flex
- YACC/Bison

## üìù Note

This repository is part of the CSL411 Compiler Lab course. Each experiment is designed to reinforce specific Course Outcomes (COs) related to compiler design and implementation.
